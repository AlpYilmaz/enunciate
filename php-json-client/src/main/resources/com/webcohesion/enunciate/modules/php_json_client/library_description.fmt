<p>
  The PHP JSON client-side library defines the PHP classes that can be (de)serialized to/from JSON.
  This is useful for accessing the resources that are published by this application, but only
  those that produce a JSON representation of their resources (content type "application/json").
</p>

<p>
  This library requires the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php">json_encode</a> function which was included in PHP versions 5.2.0+.

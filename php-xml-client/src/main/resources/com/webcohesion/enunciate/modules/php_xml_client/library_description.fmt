<p>
  The PHP client-side library defines the PHP classes that can be (de)serialized to/from XML.
  This is useful for accessing the resources that are published by this application, but only
  those that produce a XML representation of their resources.
</p>

<p>
  This library leverages the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php">XMLReader</a> and
  <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlwriter.php">XMLWriter</a> tools that were included in PHP
  versions 5.1.0+.
